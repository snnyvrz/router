TanStack Start is a full-stack React framework powered by TanStack Router. It provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more, powered by TanStack Router, Vinxi, and Vite. It is ready to deploy to your favorite hosting provider!

## Router or Start?

TanStack Router is a powerful, type-safe, and full-featured routing system for React applications. It is designed to handle the beefiest of full-stack routing requirements with ease. TanStack Start builds on top of Router's type system to provide type-safe full-stack APIs that keep you in the fast lane.

What you get with TanStack Router:

- 100% inferred TypeScript support
- Typesafe navigation
- Nested Routing and layout routes
- Built-in Route Loaders w/ SWR Caching
- Designed for client-side data caches (TanStack Query, SWR, etc.)
- Automatic route prefetching
- Asynchronous route elements and error boundaries
- File-based Route Generation
- Typesafe JSON-first Search Params state management APIs
- Path and Search Parameter Schema Validation
- Search Param Navigation APIs
- Custom Search Param parser/serializer support
- Search param middleware
- Route matching/loading middleware

What you get with TanStack Start:

- Full-document SSR
- Streaming
- Server Functions / RPCs
- Bundling
- Deployment
- Full-Stack Type Safety

**In summary, use TanStack Router for client-side routing and TanStack Start for full-stack routing.**

## How does it work?

TanStack Start uses a tool called **Vinxi** to bundle and deploy your application. In fact, this is the same tool that powers Solid Start! With Vinxi, we can do a few things we couldn't do before:

- Provide a unified API for SSR, streaming, and hydration
- Extract server-only code from your client-side code (e.g. server functions)
- Bundle your application for deployment to any hosting provider

## When should I use it?

TanStack Start is perfect for you if you want to build a full-stack React application with the following requirements:

- Full-document SSR & Hydration
- Streaming
- Server Functions / RPCs
- Full-Stack Type Safety
- Robust Routing
- Rich Client-Side Interactivity

## When might I not want to use it?

TanStack Start is not for you if:

- Your site will be 100% static
- Your goal is a server-rendered site with zero JS or minimal client-side interactivity
- You're looking for a React-Server-Component-first framework. (We'll support RSCs soon in our own awesome flavor!)
